## Documentation 

[FlyLight Project Homepage](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight)

## Intro

FlyLight makes its primary data available via VFB as well as through dedicated websites for expression patterns of Generation 1 GAL4 and LexA lines and for split-GAL4 lines. Generation 1, split hemidriver, and stable split combination lines are available primarily from the Bloomington Stock Center. Stable split lines can also be requested via the split-GAL4 website.

## FlyLight Data and Resources

While FlyLight's data is intergrated & indexed on [VFB](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=VFB_00101567,AllDatasets) and direct link out provided to the images on these sites they can be directly searched:

[Browse the Generation 1 GAL4 expression patterns](https://flweb.janelia.org/)

[Browse the Generation 1 MCFO (single neuron) patterns](https://gen1mcfo.janelia.org/)

[Browse the Split-GAL4 Expression Patterns](https://splitgal4.janelia.org/)

[Browse the Raw Image Collection](https://flylight-raw.janelia.org/cgi-bin/raw.cgi)
