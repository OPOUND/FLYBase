description: >
    FAFB is a sparse connectome of the complete adult cephalic brain. This group is working towards building the first dense synaptic-resolution connectome of an adult fly's central nervous system (brain and ventral nerve cord). This is part of an international collaboration with HHMI Janelia Research Campus in the US, the MRC LMB in Cambridge and the University of Oxford Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, funded by the Wellcome. The electron microscopy volumes that underpin our neural reconstruction are generated at Janelia.
