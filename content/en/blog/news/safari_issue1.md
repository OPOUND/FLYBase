     Virtual Fly Brain 3D browser won't load on Safari Version 15.3 (17612.4.9.1.8)
---

We are aware that VFB's secure websocket connection is failing to connect on the latest version of Safari on MacOS meaning that no data can be pulled from our servers. VFB worked correctly on previous versions of safari (e.g. Version 15.3 (15612.4.9.1.7, 15612)) additionally we are aware of other issues with this release so we hope a fix from Apple will be quickly released. We will try and find a workaround if possible but in the meantime we recomend using chrome/chromium browser until Apple can resolve the issue.
