	Predicted neurotransmitters for EM neurons are now being shown on VFB! They are currently available for Hemibrain and MANC datasets.
---

We now incorporate neurotransmitter predictions for Hemibrain neurons from [Eckstein et al. (2024)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.03.016) (conf_nt predictions) and MANC neurons from [Takemura et al. (2023)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.05.543757), with more coming soon.

_Note that these studies only worked with a limited set of neurotransmitters and assumed a single neurotransmitter per neuron (see publications for further detail). Neurons with fewer than 100 presynapses are also excluded._

Predictions appear under 'Relationships' in the Term Info if available for a particular neuron, giving the confidence level and reference publication.
