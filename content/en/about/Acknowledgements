## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Arnim Jenett of HHMI Janelia Research Campus, and Kei Ito and Kazunori Shinomiya of Tokyo University for the painted adult brain stack that we use on the 3D Brain Viewer.

We thank the group of A.S. Chiang (Brain Research Center, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan) for making their FlyCircuit raw data available. We also thank Kei Ito (Tokyo University) and Tzumin Lee (HHMI Janelia Research Campus) for providing us with their neuroblast clone data.

We also thank the following researchers for their hard work in reviewing elements of VFB categories:

- Liria Masuda Nakagawa (Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge) for review of the larval olfactory system;
- Orie Shafer (Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan) for reviewing VFB pacemaker neuron terms and related content;
- Jo Young (Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh) for review of the central complex;
- Gregory Jefferis (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge) for review of the adult olfactory system.

Virtual Fly Brain uses open source software from a variety of sources:

- the [OWL-API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) underpins handling of all ontology metadata and queries on VFB with help from the [OWLtools](https://code.google.com/p/owltools/) and [brain](https://github.com/loopasam/Brain/wiki) libraries;
- the super fast ontology queries that drive VFB would not be possible without the [elk reasoner](http://code.google.com/p/elk-reasoner/).
