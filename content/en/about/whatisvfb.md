# What is Virtual Fly Brain?

Welcome to **Virtual Fly Brain (VFB)** - an interactive tool for neurobiologists to explore the detailed neuroanatomy, neuron connectivity, and gene expression of _Drosophila melanogaster_. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers to find relevant anatomical information and reagents.

We integrate the neuroanatomical and expression data from the published literature, as well as image datasets onto the same brain template, making it possible to run cross searches, find similar neurons, and compare image data on our [3D Viewer](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto).
