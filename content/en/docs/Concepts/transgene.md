Here we present details of how single transgenes are curated

Expression of single transgenes are curated from the published literature into [FlyBase](http://flybase.org) as expression statements. [Virtual Fly Brain (VFB)](https://virtualflybrain.org) combines hosted images with neuroanatomical, expression and genetic data from [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/) in Neo4j and maps them onto [Central Nervious System (CNS)](https://www.virtualflybrain.org/term/central-nervous-system-fbbt_00005094/) [templates](/tags/template/) where they can be queried using [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) and [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/).
