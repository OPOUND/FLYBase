Here we present details of how single transgenes are curated

<img src="/images/transgene_curation.png" max-width="100%" alt="Transgene expression into FlyBase and Virtual Fly Brain (VFB)" >

Expression of single transgenes are curated from the published literature into FlyBase as expression statements. Virtual Fly Brain (VFB) combines hosted images with neuroanatomical, expression and genetic data from FlyBase in Neo4j and maps them onto Central Nervious System (CNS) templates where they can be queried using [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) and [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/).
