  Confidence values for predictions on VFB.
---

Some annotations on VFB are based on predictions, for example, predicted neurotransmitters for neurons in electron microscopy datasets (from [Eckstein et al., 2024](http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0259490)). Where available, we include the confidence of these predictions (as a badge next to the annotation), as well as a link to the publication - in the example below, this would be by clicking on the 'DOI' badge.
